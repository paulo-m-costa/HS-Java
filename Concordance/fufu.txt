Little Bunny Fufu

Little bunny Fufu
Running through the forest
Picking up the field mice
and bopping them on the head

Along came the Good Fairy
And she said:
Little Bunny Fufu
I don't want to see you
Picking up the field mice
And bopping them on the head

I'll give you two chances
Then I'll turn you into a Goon

The Moral: Hare today, Goon tomorrow
